In Go, **variables** are explicitly declared and used by the compiler to e.g. check type-correctness of function calls.

You can declare multiple variables at once.
Go will infer the type of initialized variables.
Variables declared without a corresponding initialization are zero-valued.
The `:=` syntax is shorthand for declaring and initializing a variable.
