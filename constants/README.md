Go supports *constants* of character, string, boolean and numeric values.

A `const` statement can appear anywhere a `var` statement can.

A numeric constant has no type until it's given one, such as by an explicit conversion.

A number can be given a type by using it in a context that requires one, such as variable assignment, a or function call.
